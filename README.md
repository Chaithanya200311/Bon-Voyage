# Bon Voyage

Bon Voyage is a website which facilitates users to list the buses, trains and planes from one destination to another and sort them by prices and duration, easing the process of finding the best mode of transport to a particular place.


## Birth of the Idea

We, a group of four friends, first encountered the challenge of needing to compare prices across several travel sites and means of transportation when we were planning our trip from Trivandrum to Bengaluru and back. The idea was actually conceived as a result of the realisation that comparing and organising buses, trains, and flights by price range and duration in one location would save users a significant amount of time and effort.
## Description & Working

A website called Bon Voyage allows users to compare several means of transportation, including buses, trains, and aeroplanes, on a single platform, saving them a tonne of time.
While planning a trip, it might be confusing to decide on the form of transportation, budget, and timing.Comparing several websites and apps might make it difficult to make decisions and waste time.
By using the aforementioned factors, this website will choose the appropriate mode, making travel more convenient. The website will sort and provide the best possibilities based on your selection of the departure, destination, date, and preferred modes.
## Timeline of the project

The project was created at a 30-hour nationwide hackathon held by FOSS United on March 4 and 5, 2023.
The project was completed in its entirety in these 2 days. By the 4th of March 2023, the Front End was finished. The Back End had been completed by the evening of 5th March, and the project had then undergone some last level polishing.
## Future Prospects

This project is the Phase 1 of a larger project that we are building on. We are working on creating a complete journey buddy, an assistant who takes care of our journey from scratch to everything. It would give us weather predictions of the destination, connected travel modes in remote areas, local cuisines and nearest tourist destinations, etc.

The following features are expected to be rolled out in the upcoming phases: 
- Live Weather
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform
